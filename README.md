# Q&A

**Q: Why not use TypeScript for both the frontend and backend development?**

A:

* When I embarked on this project, I was largely inspired by [Hugh](https://github.com/IgnoranceAI/hugh), a project
  primarily coded in Python, supplemented with HTML and a touch of JavaScript. To broaden the horizons of text-to-speech
  providers, I revamped the backend logic using Go, transforming it into a Go-based project.
* Crafting backend logic with Go feels incredibly intuitive‚Äîit distills everything down to a single binary.
* Moreover, my skills in frontend development were somewhat rudimentary at that time.
