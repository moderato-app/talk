  # Provide your domain list and email, server will try to generate cert for you.
  # Port 80 and 443 will be used. Request to HTTP(80) will be redirected to HTTPS(443)
  # By default, CertMagic stores assets on the local file system in $HOME/.local/share/certmagic (and honors $XDG_DATA_HOME if set). CertMagic will create the directory if it does not exist. If writes are denied, things will not be happy, so make sure CertMagic can write to it!
